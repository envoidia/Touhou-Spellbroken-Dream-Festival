Touhou Spellbroken Dream Festival
東方弾夢記
v1.10b

A Touhou-style fangame by Incandescence System (ISY)
インカンデセンス・システム（ＩＳＹ）による東方二次創作ゲーム

How to install:
Simply extract the contents of the game's zip folder to whereever you want it to be, then run th_sdf.exe. If that doesn't work, try running th_sdf_legacy.exe instead. If that also doesn't work, you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime or update DirectX. If that doesn't work either, contact me, and I'll try to help.

How to play:
This is a danmaku or "bullet hell" game, so your goal is to shoot down your opponents while dodging their bullets.
The basic controls are arrow keys to navigate, Z to confirm or shoot, X to go back or deny, and shift to focus (slowing movement for more precise dodging, and changing your shots).
These controls can be changed in config.exe. The in-game text assumes the default controls, so if you change anything, keep that in mind.
There's a more detailed overview of the way the game works in the manual, which you can read by navigating to the "View Manual" option on the main menu and selecting it.

How to uninstall:
If you've decided that you've had enough, simply delete the files in the th_SDF directory. It's gone now.

Translation:
If you want to translate the game or install a translation, you'll need to enable hidden files to see the game text files in /txt/lang/
